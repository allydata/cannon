The order of what I did to get this working is strange, but I'm working on windows
I have a Cloudcannon id, sign-in with Dropbox
On Cloudcannon - create new site and connect it to dropbox - dropbox will create a empty folder for the site backup
On cloudcannon - choose a template - it will sinc to the previously empty dropbox folder
From dropbox - download the folder to a zip file of the jekyll site
upzip the site
create a repository on github
create a gitinore - chose jekyll
upload the unzipped files
setup - github pages from master branch
